# Hashcode Removal using ffmpeg, object detection and inpainting.
# The code in this repo is not final and is an idea draft only it may need small or major edits to work in production the code is provided as is.

The script is designed to remove a randomly generated watermark that moves around the screen from a video. The approach used in the script is to apply object detection to track the position of the watermark in each frame, and then apply image inpainting to remove the watermark from the frame.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the script:

	The script starts by setting some variables, including the input and output file names, the path to the object detection model, and the object detection threshold.

	Next, the script enters a loop that iterates over each frame of the input video.

	For each frame, the script uses ffmpeg to extract the frame as a PNG image.

	The script then runs object detection on the frame image using a pre-trained model specified by the model_path variable. The threshold variable is used to determine the confidence threshold for object detection.

	The script extracts the bounding box coordinates of the detected object (the watermark) from the object detection output.

	If a bounding box is detected, the script checks if the watermark has moved significantly from the last frame. If it has, the current frame is used as the last frame and the current bounding box is used as the last bounding box. If it hasn't, the last frame and last bounding box are used instead.

	The script applies image inpainting to remove the watermark from the frame using the inpaint.py script. The center_x and center_y variables are used to specify the center of the watermark in the frame.

	The output frame from the inpainting process is used as the input for the next frame.

	The output frame is then appended to the output video using ffmpeg.

	The loop continues until all frames of the input video have been processed.

Overall, the script uses a combination of object detection and image inpainting techniques to remove a randomly generated watermark that moves around the screen from a video.
